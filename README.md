# Image_Classification_ON_Browser

## Project Description
Building a browser based image Classification using a lite weight Image classification model, and getting inference using ONNX runtime.

Entire Flow
1. Take camera feed as input, Give it to a trained Lightweight model for inference.
2. the outputs of the model are displayed on the screen.

Project Pipeline
1. Finding an light weight model
2. Convert the model to onnx runtime
3. Run Trial Infernece on local system.
4. Webapplication: 
	a. Asking user permission for camera
	b. website with cool background and way to display the detection
5. Main.py
	a. Take the camerafeed and preprocess based on selected model
	b. Divide the feed in batches to handle large video sessions
	c. Give the model the feeds 
	d. Post process the outputs and display it.
